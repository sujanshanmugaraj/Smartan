## 🎯 Exercise Types & Posture Rules

### 1. Bicep Curl
**Primary Rule**: Elbow angle analysis
- **Correct Form**: Elbow angle > 160° (extended) and < 60° (fully curled)
- **Logic**: Measures angle between shoulder-elbow-wrist points
- **Feedback**: "Correct", "Too Curled" based on angle thresholds
- **Rep Counting**: Transitions from extended (>160°) to curled (<60°)
- **Multi-Person**: Individual tracking for each detected person

### 2. Lateral Raise  
**Primary Rule**: Wrist-shoulder vertical alignment
- **Correct Form**: Vertical distance between wrist and shoulder (100-160 pixels)
- **Logic**: Calculates Y-axis difference between shoulder and wrist positions
- **Feedback**: "Good" (optimal range), "Too Low" (insufficient elevation)
- **Rep Counting**: Transitions from lowered (<100px) to raised (>140px)
- **Multi-Person**: Separate rep counting for each individual

### 3. Squat
**Primary Rule**: Knee angle and depth analysis  
- **Correct Form**: Knee angle between 90°-150° (proper squat depth)
- **Logic**: Measures angle between hip-knee-ankle triangle
- **Feedback**: "Correct" (good depth), "Too High" (insufficient depth), "Good" (acceptable)
- **Rep Counting**: Transitions from standing (>150°) to squatting (<100°)
- **Multi-Person**: Individual form analysis for each person

### 4. Jumping Jack
**Primary Rule**: Limb separation distance
- **Correct Form**: Hand distance >200px AND foot distance >100px
- **Logic**: Calculates horizontal distances between corresponding limbs
- **Feedback**: "Good" (arms and legs properly extended), "Closed" (insufficient separation)
- **Rep Counting**: Transitions from closed to open position
- **Multi-Person**: Synchronized analysis for group exercises

## 🧠 Logic Behind the Rules

### Geometric Analysis Approach
1. **Angle Calculation**: Uses arctangent mathematics to compute joint angles
   ```python
   radians = np.arctan2(c[1]-b[1], c[0]-b[0]) - np.arctan2(a[1]-b[1], a[0]-b[0])
   angle = np.abs(radians*180.0/np.pi)
   ```

2. **Distance Measurement**: Euclidean distance for limb separation
3. **Smoothing Algorithm**: Moving average filter to reduce noise
4. **State Machine**: Tracks exercise phases for accurate rep counting
5. **Person Tracking**: Individual state machines for multi-person scenarios

### Threshold Determination
- **Empirical Testing**: Thresholds derived from analyzing multiple sample videos
- **Biomechanical Principles**: Based on optimal exercise form guidelines
- **Adaptive Logic**: Different thresholds for different exercise phases
- **Person-Specific**: Individual calibration for multi-person analysis
